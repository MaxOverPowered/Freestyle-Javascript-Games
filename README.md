# Freestyle-Javascript-Games

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Freestyle JavaScript Game repository!

ðŸ‘‰ This JavaScript project includes three fun mini-games from different categories, each built using the best practices and modern web technologies. ðŸŽ® Each game has a unique design and users will be thrilled to try each one to experience the variety on offer. ðŸ¤©


## Description
In this project, I have created three mini-games using JavaScript. The first game is a fighting game where the player has to defeat their opponent using different moves. The second game is about a frog crossing the street and avoiding obstacles to get to the other side. The third game is an obstacle course where an avatar must jump over obstacles to reach the finish line.
